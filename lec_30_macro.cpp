// macro example
/*
-> Even Before the code gets compiled, all the places where you have used PI,
 it gets replaced by the value of 3.14. thatâ€™s the utility of macro.
- so that way no storage space is consumed compared to when a variable is 
being used instead of a macro.
- also the value which is defined by macro, cannot be modified 
inside the program
